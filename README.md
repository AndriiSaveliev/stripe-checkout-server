# Stripe Checkout Integration

This project demonstrates how to integrate Stripe Checkout using a custom Express.js server and a simple frontend.

## 💳 Live Demo

You can test the live payment flow here:  
👉 [https://byuvia-stripe.vercel.app](https://byuvia-stripe.vercel.app)

After clicking **"Pay $10"**, you will be redirected to Stripe Checkout.  
Upon successful payment, you'll land on the `success.html` page:  
✅ [https://byuvia-stripe.vercel.app/success.html](https://byuvia-stripe.vercel.app/success.html)

If you cancel the payment, you'll be redirected to the `cancel.html` page:
